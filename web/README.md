# Gym Tracking Application - Web Client

## Overview

This project is an application designed to work with Crux, a Rust framework for creating cross-platform applications with a single codebase. The application showcases various features including real-time data updates and HTTP requests handling, leveraging Crux's capabilities.

### Directory Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```plaintext
.
├── Cargo.toml
├── dist
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── web-b999ef978b234b94.js
│   └── web-b999ef978b234b94_bg.wasm
├── index.html
└── src
    ├── core.rs
    ├── http.rs
    ├── main.rs
    ├── pages
    └── sse.rs
```

#### Cargo.toml

The Cargo manifest file for Rust projects, containing metadata about the project and its dependencies.

#### dist/

This directory contains the compiled output of the project, including:

index.html: The main HTML file for the web application.
web-b999ef978b234b94.js and web-b999ef978b234b94_bg.wasm: The JavaScript and WebAssembly files generated by the Rust-to-WebAssembly compilation process.
index.html
A secondary HTML file possibly used for development or testing purposes.

#### src/

The source code directory, containing the Rust files that make up the core of the application:

- core.rs: Handles the core logic and state management of the application.
- http.rs: Manages HTTP requests and responses.
- main.rs: The entry point of the application, setting up the main components and rendering the initial view.
- pages/: A directory for organizing different page components or modules.
- sse.rs: Manages Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates.

### Application Features

#### Integration with Crux

The application utilizes Crux for state management and cross-platform capabilities, allowing it to share a significant amount of code across different platforms.

## Real-time Data Updates

Using Server-Sent Events (SSE) handled in sse.rs, the application can receive real-time updates from the server, ensuring that the user interface stays in sync with the latest data.

## HTTP Requests Handling

The http.rs file manages asynchronous HTTP requests, making it easy to fetch and update data from external APIs. This is crucial for applications that need to interact with remote servers.

Modular Design
The project is structured in a modular fashion, with different responsibilities separated into distinct files. This makes the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Install Rust: Ensure you have Rust installed on your machine. You can install Rust from rust-lang.org.

`cargo build`

1. Build the Project: Navigate to the project directory and run:

`trunk serve --open --port 3001`

This command will build the project and start a local development server.

1. Access the Application: Open your web browser and navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:8080/> to see the application in action.
