## Overview

This project is a comprehensive application designed to track gym progress, manage workout programs, and handle various fitness-related data. It integrates with Crux to provide robust and scalable functionalities. The project is divided into multiple components, each handling specific aspects of the application's requirements.

## Components

### Database

The database directory contains SQL scripts for initializing, seeding, and managing the database schema. It also includes query files categorized under various functionalities such as exercises, progress tracking, users, workout programs, and workout tracking.

- `Queries`: Contains SQL scripts for various database operations.
- `Schema`: Defines the structure of the database tables and their relationships.
- `Seeds`: Initial data to populate the database tables.

### Server

The server directory hosts the backend server written in Rust, utilizing Actix-web for handling HTTP requests and Diesel for database interactions.

- `src`: Contains the source code for the server including handlers, models, and database access modules.
- `Cargo.toml`: Configuration file for Rust dependencies.

### Shared

The shared directory includes common logic and utilities shared across the project, particularly the Rust code generated by Crux for seamless integration between different modules.

- `src`: Contains the core application logic and capabilities.
- `build.rs`: Build script for generating necessary bindings and configurations.

### Shared Types

The shared_types directory holds the code generated by Crux for cross-platform data structures, ensuring type safety and consistency across different parts of the application.

generated: Contains generated code for various platforms (Java, Swift, TypeScript).

### Web

The web directory includes the frontend part of the application built with Yew, a Rust framework for creating web applications with WebAssembly.

src: Contains the source code for the web application including the core logic, HTTP handlers, and pages.
index.html: Entry point for the web application.

## Features

### Integration with Crux

Crux is used to manage the application's state and ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend. It helps in maintaining a single source of truth and provides a robust framework for handling complex state management.

### Workout and Progress Tracking

The application allows users to create and manage workout programs, log their progress, and track various fitness metrics. It supports various workout types and provides detailed reports on user performance.

### User Management

Users can register, authenticate, and manage their profiles. The application ensures secure handling of user data and provides personalized experiences based on user preferences and past activities.

### Responsive Web Application

Built with Yew, the web application offers a responsive and interactive user interface, providing a seamless user experience across different devices.

## How to Run

Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone gh repo clone rsstdd/gym-tracker
cd gym-tracker
```

### Setup the Database

Navigate to the database directory and execute the SQL scripts to initialize and seed the database.

### Build and Run the Server

```bash
cd server
cargo build
cargo run
```

### Build the Web Application

```bash
cd web
trunk build
```

### Serve the Web Application

```bash
trunk serve --open --port 3001
```
